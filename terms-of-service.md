We each agree to contract in the English language. If we provide a translation of the Terms, we do so for your convenience only, and the English Terms will solely govern our relationship.

We are not liable for failure or delay in performance to the extent caused by circumstances beyond our reasonable control. If you do not comply with the Terms, and ECAD Labs does not take action right away, this does not mean that ECAD Labs is giving up any rights that it may have (such as taking action in the future). If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms. The Terms are the entire agreement between you and ECAD Labs relating to its subject and supersede any prior or contemporaneous agreements on that subject.
