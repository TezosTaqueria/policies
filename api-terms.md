API Terms of Service
===
ECAD Labs Inc. ("**ECAD Labs**") provides Users with application programming interfaces and related developer services and websites (collectively, the "**API**" or "**APIs**"). 

These API Terms of Service (the "**API Terms**") and ECAD Labs's general Terms of Service (the "**Terms**") govern your use of the APIs. Unless defined in the API Terms, words and phrases must be interpreted as defined in the Terms, and the API Terms and the Terms must be interpreted consistently with each other.

## Section 1: Application
### a. Terms of Service
The APIs form part of the Services defined in our [Terms of Service](https://www.ecadlabs.com/tos) (the "**Terms**"), which govern your relationship with us.

### b. Agreement to be Bound
Your use of the APIs constitutes your agreement to be bound by the Terms and these API Terms.

### c. Entity Level Acceptance
If you are using the APIs on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have authority to bind that entity to the Terms and these API Terms. By accepting the Terms and API Terms, you are doing so on behalf of that entity (and all references to "you" in the Terms refer to that entity).

## Section 2: Using Our APIs
### a. Your End Users
You will require your end-users to comply with (and not knowingly enable them to violate) applicable laws, regulations, the Terms and API Terms.

### c. Permitted Access
You will only access (or attempt to access) an API by the means described in the documentation of that API. You will not misrepresent or mask your own identity or that of any API client you may use unless that usage is expressly contemplated and permitted in the applicable API documentation.

### d. API Limitations
ECAD Labs may set and enforce limits on your use of the APIs (e.g. limiting the number of API requests that you may make or the number of users you may serve) at our sole discretion. You agree to any limitations documented with each API and will not attempt to circumvent such restrictions. If you would like to use any API beyond these limits, you must obtain ECAD Labs's express consent (and ECAD Labs may decline any request or make acceptance conditional on your agreement to additional terms and charges for that use). To seek such approval, contact ECAD Labs directly.

### f. Communication with ECAD Labs
We may send you certain communications in connection with your use of the APIs. Please review the applicable API documentation for information about opting in and out of certain types of communication.

## Section 3: Your API Clients
### a. API Clients and Monitoring
The APIs are designed to help you enhance your websites, applications and other usees of data ("API Client(s)"). YOU AGREE THAT ECAD LABS MAY MONITOR THE USE OF THE APIS TO ENSURE QUALITY, IMPROVE ECAD LABS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND VERIFY YOUR COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS. This monitoring may include ECAD Labs accessing and using your API Client, for example, to identify security issues that could affect ECAD Labs or its users. You will not interfere with this monitoring. ECAD Labs may use any technical means to overcome such interference. ECAD Labs may suspend access to the APIs by you or your API Client without notice if we reasonably believe that you are in violation of the Terms.

### b. Security
You will use commercially reasonable efforts to protect user information collected by your API Client, including personally identifiable information ("PII"), from unauthorized access or use and will promptly report to your users any unauthorized access or use of such information to the extent required by applicable law.

### c. Ownership
ECAD Labs does not acquire ownership in your API Clients, and by using our APIs, you do not acquire ownership of any rights in our APIs or the content that is accessed through our APIs.

### d. User Privacy and API Clients
You will comply with all applicable privacy laws and regulations, including those applying to PII. You will provide and adhere to a privacy policy for your API Client that clearly and accurately describes to users of your API Client what user information you collect and how you use and share such information with ECAD Labs and third parties.

## Section 4: Prohibitions and Confidentiality
### a. API Prohibitions
When using the APIs, you may not (or allow those acting on your behalf to):

1. Sublicense an API for use by a third party. Consequently, you will not create an API Client that functions substantially the same as the APIs and offer it for use by third parties.
2. Perform an action with the intent of introducing to ECAD products and services any viruses, worms, defects, Trojan horses, malware, or any items of a destructive nature.
3. Defame, abuse, harass, stalk, or threaten others.
4. Interfere with or disrupt the APIs or the servers or networks providing the APIs.
5. Promote or facilitate unlawful online gambling or disruptive commercial messages or advertisements.
6. Reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code from any API or any related software, except to the extent that this restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law.
7. Use the APIs for any activities where the use or failure of the APIs could lead to death, personal injury, or environmental damage (such as the operation of nuclear facilities, air traffic control, or life support systems).
8. Use the APIs to process or store any data subject to lawful prohibition or restriction.
9. Remove, obscure, or alter any ECAD Labs terms of service or any links to or notices of those terms.
10. Unless otherwise specified in writing, ECAD Labs does not intend to use the APIs to create obligations under any specific law or regulation governing the storage, retention or security of data.

### b. Confidential Matters
Access credentials (such as passwords, keys, and client IDs), if applicable, are intended to be used by you and identify your API Client. You will keep your credentials confidential and make reasonable efforts to prevent and discourage other API Clients from using your credentials.
Our communications to you and our APIs may contain ECAD Labs’s confidential information. ECAD Labs’s confidential information includes any materials, communications, and information that are marked confidential or that would normally be considered confidential under the circumstances. If you receive any such information, you will not disclose it to any third party without ECAD Labs's prior written consent. ECAD Labs's confidential information does not include information that you independently developed, that was rightfully given to you by a third party without confidentiality obligation, or that becomes public through no fault of your own. You may disclose ECAD Labs's confidential information when compelled to do so by law if you provide us with reasonable prior notice unless a court orders that we not receive notice.

## Section 5: Content
### a. Content Accessible Through our APIs
Our APIs frequently transmit third-party content (such as compiled code, text, images, videos, audio, or software). This content is the sole responsibility of the person that makes it available. We may sometimes review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies or the Terms, and we may remove or refuse to display content. Finally, content accessible through our APIs may be subject to intellectual property rights, and, if so, you may not use it unless you are authorized to do so by the owner of that content or are otherwise permitted by law. Your access to the content provided by the APIs may be restricted, limited, or filtered in accordance with applicable law, regulation, and policy.

### b. Submission of Content
Some of our APIs allow the submission of content. ECAD Labs does not acquire any ownership of any intellectual property rights in the content that you submit to our APIs through your API Client, except as expressly provided in the Terms. For the sole purpose of enabling ECAD Labs to provide, secure, and improve the APIs (and the related service(s)) and only in accordance with the applicable ECAD Labs privacy policies, you give ECAD a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, sublicensable, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to use, host, store, modify, communicate, and publish content submitted, posted, or displayed to or from the APIs through your API Client. Before you submit content to our APIs through your API Client, you will ensure that you have the necessary rights (including the necessary rights from your end users) to grant us the license.

### c. Retrieval of content
When a user's non-public content is obtained through the APIs, you may not expose that content to other users or to third parties without explicit opt-in consent from that user.

### d. Data Portability
ECAD Labs supports data portability. For as long as you use or store any user data that you obtained through the APIs, you agree to enable your users to export their equivalent data to other services or applications of their choice in a way that's substantially as fast and easy as exporting such data from similar products and services, subject to applicable laws, and you agree that you will not make that data available to third parties who do not also abide by this obligation.

### e. Prohibitions on Content
Unless expressly permitted by the content owner or by applicable law, you will not, and will not permit your end users or others acting on your behalf to, do the following with content returned from the APIs:

1. Scrape, build databases, or otherwise create permanent copies of such content, or keep cached copies longer than permitted by the cache header;
2. Copy, translate, modify, create a derivative work of, sell, lease, lend, convey, distribute, publicly display, or sublicense to any third party;
3. Misrepresent the source or ownership; or
4. Remove, obscure, or alter any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices; or falsify or delete any author attributions, legal notices, or other labels of the origin or source of material.

### f. Your Obligations Post-Termination
Upon any termination of the API Terms or discontinuation of your access to an API, you will immediately stop using the API and delete any cached or stored content. ECAD Labs may independently communicate with any account owner whose account(s) are associated with your API Client and developer credentials to provide notice of the termination of your right to use an API.
