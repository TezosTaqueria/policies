Pinnacle LAbs Limited ("**Pinnacle Labs**") provides Users with application programming interfaces and related developer services and websites (collectively, the "**API**" or "**APIs**"). 

These API Terms of Service (the "**API Terms**") and Pinnacle Labs's general Terms of Service (the "**Terms**") govern your use of the APIs. Unless defined in the API Terms, words and phrases must be interpreted as defined in the Terms, and the API Terms and the Terms must be interpreted consistently with each other.

We may provide concise summaries of specific terms for convenience. Only the full-length below each summary is binding upon you and us.

Your use of the APIs constitutes your agreement to be bound by the Terms and these API Terms.

### c. Entity Level Acceptance
**Short version:** *If you use the APIs on behalf of another entity, you bind that entity to these Terms.*

If you are using the APIs on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have authority to bind that entity to the Terms and these API Terms. By accepting the Terms and API Terms, you are doing so on behalf of that entity (and all references to "you" in the Terms refer to that entity).

### d. API Limitations
**Short version:** *We may enforce limits and charge fees for the use of our APIs.*

Pinnacle Labs may set and enforce limits on your use of the APIs (e.g. limiting the number of API requests that you may make or the number of users you may serve) at our sole discretion. You agree to any limitations documented with each API and will not circumvent such restrictions. You must obtain Pinnacle Labs's express consent to use any API beyond these limits. Pinnacle Labs may decline any request to exceed API limits or make acceptance conditional on your agreement to additional terms or charges. To seek such approval, contact Pinnacle Labs directly.

This monitoring may include Pinnacle Labs accessing your API Client, for example, to identify security issues that could affect Pinnacle Labs or its users. You will not interfere with this monitoring. Pinnacle Labs may use any technical means to overcome such interference. Pinnacle Labs may suspend you or your API Client's access to the APIs without notice if we reasonably believe you have violated the [Terms](https://pinnaclelabs.limited/tos) or API Terms.

### b. Security
**Short version:** *You must protect user data collected by your API Client.*

You will use commercially reasonable efforts to protect user-information collected from your API Client, including personally identifiable information ("PII"), from unauthorized access or use.

## Section 4: Prohibitions and Confidentiality
### a. API Prohibitions

When using the APIs, you may not (or allow those acting on your behalf to):

3. Defame, abuse, harass, stalk, or threaten others.

8. Use the APIs to process or store any data subject to lawful prohibition or restriction.
9. Remove, obscure, or alter any Pinnacle Labs terms of service or any links to or notices of those terms.

**Short version:** *Access credentials and sensitive communications with us must remain confidential.*

Access credentials (such as passwords, keys, and client IDs), if applicable, are intended to be used by you and identify your API Client. You will keep your credentials confidential and make reasonable efforts to prevent and discourage other API Clients from using your credentials.

Our communications to you and our APIs may contain Pinnacle Labs’s confidential information. Pinnacle Labs’s confidential information includes any materials, communications, and information that are marked confidential or that would typically be considered confidential under the circumstances. If you receive any such information, you will not disclose it to any third party without Pinnacle Labs's prior written consent. Pinnacle Labs's confidential information does not include information that you independently developed, that was rightfully given to you by a third party without confidentiality obligation, or that becomes public through no fault of your own. You may disclose Pinnacle Labs's confidential information when compelled to do so by law if you provide us with reasonable prior notice unless a court orders that we not receive notice.

## Section 5: Content
### a. Content Accessible Through our APIs
**Short version:** *Content transmitted through our APIs must comply with our policies, [Terms](https://pinnaclelabs.limited/tos) and API Terms.*

Our APIs frequently transmit third-party content (such as compiled code, encrypted data, distributed ledger and indexer data, text, software, images and other media). This content is the sole responsibility of the person that makes it available. We may sometimes review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies or the Terms. We may remove or refuse to provide access to APIs where we have grounds to believe that content contravenes our policies, [Terms](https://pinnaclelabs.limited/tos) or API Terms. Finally, content accessible through our APIs may be subject to intellectual property rights, and, if so, you may not use it unless you are authorized to do so by the owner of that content or are otherwise permitted by law. Your access to the content provided by the APIs may be restricted, limited, or filtered under applicable law, regulation, and policy. However, we have no obligation to do so.

### b. Submission of Content
**Short version:** *You grant us a limited, non-exclusive and royalty-free license to handle the content you submit through the APIs.*

Some of our APIs allow the submission of content. Pinnacle Labs does not acquire any ownership of any intellectual property rights in the content that you submit to our APIs through your API Client, except as expressly provided in the Terms. For the sole purpose of enabling Pinnacle Labs to provide, secure, and improve the APIs (and the related service(s)) and following he applicable Pinnacle Labs privacy policies, you give Pinnacle Labs a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, sublicensable, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to use, host, store, modify, communicate, and publish the content submitted, posted, or displayed to or from the APIs through your API Client. Before you submit content to our APIs through your API Client, you will ensure that you have the necessary rights (including the necessary rights from your end users) to grant us the license.

### c. Retrieval of content
**Short version:** *You must have user permission to expose non-public content through our APIs.*

When a user's non-public content is obtained through the APIs, you may not expose that content to other users or third parties without explicit opt-in consent from that user.

**Short version:** *You must support data portability that allows your users to export their data.*

Pinnacle Labs supports data portability. For as long as you use or store any user data that you obtained through the APIs, you agree to enable your users to export their equivalent data to other services or applications of their choice in a way that's substantially as fast and easy as exporting such data from similar products and services, subject to applicable laws. You agree that you will not make that data available to third parties who do not also abide by this obligation.

### e. Prohibitions on Content
Unless expressly permitted by the content owner or by applicable law, you will not, and will not allow your end-users or others acting on your behalf to, do the following with content returned from the APIs:

1. Scrape, build databases, or otherwise create permanent copies of such content, or keep cached copies longer than permitted by the cache header;
2. Copy, translate, modify, create a derivative work of, sell, lease, lend, convey, distribute, publicly display, or sublicense to any third party;
3. Misrepresent the source or ownership; or
4. Remove, obscure, or alter any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices; or falsify or delete any author attributions, legal notices, or other labels of the origin or source of the material.

### f. Your Obligations Post-Termination
**Short version:** *You must delete cached and stored content obtained through an API upon termination or discontinuance of your access.*

Upon any termination of the API Terms or discontinuation of your access to an API, you will immediately stop using the API and delete any cached or stored content.
